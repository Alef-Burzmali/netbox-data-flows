However, data flows are not directly between physical devices or virtual machines, instead they sit at a higher application level and are relatively agnostic of the physical world under them.</p> <p>Furthermore, a device may have several network interfaces, each with zero, one or several IP addresses. An application may be configured to use a specific IP address to sent a data flow from, or to listen on or it can use any available IP address and let the operating system figure which one is used.</p> <p>For some data flows, it does not make sense to specify single IP addresses as source or as destination. For example, all the devices in a network segment may want to connect to the same DNS or LDAP servers.
